# Bank_DiceGame
A fun multiplayer "push your luck" dice game

# How To Play
Be the one with the most banked points from the pot at the end of the selected number of rounds. However, if you don't bank the pot before someone rolls a 7 the pot goes to zero, you get no points for that round, and we go to the next round.

# Rules
1. The first 3 rounds are free and any doubles rolled are face value. However, if you roll a 7 then it's 70 points added to the pot.
2. The 4th roll and on, if a 7 is rolled the pot will go to zero and you get no points for that round
3. You can 'Bank' at anytime, however, if you do you cannot bank again for that round

# Bugs
I'm sure I didn't capture all of the bugs that can be found in the game, but if you're the hosting player you can force the next player if a roll button isn't available. You also have the option to adjust the total number of rounds played and if you want to start the game over.
